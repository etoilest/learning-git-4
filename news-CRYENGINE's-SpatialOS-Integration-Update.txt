Crytek has revealed more details about the integration of Improbable¡¯s SpatialOS platform with CRYENGINE. SpatialOS is a cloud-based computational platform that lets game developers use many servers to power a single world. To bring this technology to CRYENGINE users, Crytek is working closely with both Improbable and Automaton, the developer of Mavericks: Proving Grounds, a 1,000-player shooter powered by CRYENGINE and SpatialOS.

A new video shows how the SpatialOS integration will work in CRYENGINE. The demonstration shows a level being simulated by a dedicated server while many users are playing. The clients are running in a single-player mode, while the game state is synchronized with a dedicated server over the SpatialOS network, which means additional SpatialOS tools like the Inspector can be used to manage or monitor the simulation. The scene was created in CRYENGINE using Hunt: Showdown assets for the purpose of demonstrating the SpatialOS integration with the engine only.
